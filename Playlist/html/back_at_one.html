    <h2>Brian McKnight</h2>
        <p> It's undeniable
        <p>That we should be together
        <p>It's unbelievable
        <p>How I used to say, that I'd fall never
        <p>The basis is need to know
        <p>If you don't know just how I feel
        <p>Then let me show you now that I'm, for real
        <p>If all things in time, time will reveal
        <p>(Yeah, yeah)
        <p> One, you're like a dream come true
        <p>Two, just wanna be with you
        <p>Three, girl, It's plain to see
        <p>That you're the only one for me, and
        <p>Four, repeat steps one through three
        <p>Five, make you fall in love with me
        <p>If ever I believe my work is done
        <p> Then I'll start back at one
        <p>(Yeah, yeah)
        <p>It's so incredible
        <p>The way things work themselves out
        <p> And all emotional
        <p>Once you know what it's all about (hey)
        <p>And undesirable
        <p>For us to be apart
        <p>Never would've made it very far
        <p>'Cause you know, you've got the keys to my heart, 'cause
        <p> One, you're like a dream come true
        <p>Two, just wanna be with you
        <p>Three, girl, It's plain to see
        <p>That you're the only one for me, and
        <p>Four, repeat steps one through three
        <p>Five, make you fall in love with me
        <p>If ever I believe my work is done
        <p>Then I'll start back at one
        <p>Say farewell to the dark of night
        <p>I see the comin' of the sun
        <p>I feel like a little child, whose life has just begun
        <p>You came and breathed new life
        <p>You threw out the lifeline
        <p>Just in the nick of time
        <p>One, you're like a dream come true
        <p>Two, just wanna be with you
        <p>Three, girl, It's plain to see
        <p> That you're the only one for me, and
        <p> Four, repeat steps one through three
        <p>Five, make you fall in love with me
        <p> If ever I believe my work is done
        <p> Then I'll start back at one. </p>
