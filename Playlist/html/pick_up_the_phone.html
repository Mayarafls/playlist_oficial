    <h2>Henry moodie</h2>
        <p>   Some nights, I don't even sleep        
        <p>   Chest tight with anxiety        
        <p>   Stay up to see the moon leave the sky        
        <p>   Some days, I'm not even me       
        <p>   Same old insecurities       
        <p>   They tell me there's something going wrong inside
        <p>   I've been there, down that road
        <p>   When you need me, I'll be here to let you know
        <p>   It's gonna be okay
        <p>   Everyone needs a bad day        
        <p>   Remember you told me        
        <p>   You're not alone, just pick up the phone        
        <p>   And call me whenever you're feeling lonely        
        <p>   Remember you told me        
        <p>   You're not alone, just pick up the phone        
        <p>   Break down 'cause you're breaking through        
        <p>   No sky is forever blue        
        <p>   Things bloom whenever they've seen the rain        
        <p>   Your thoughts lie, but I know the truth (I know the truth)        
        <p>   The best days are ahead of you (ahead of you)        
        <p>   Tomorrow isn't your yesterday      
        <p>   I've been there, down that road      
        <p>   When you need me, I'll be here to let you know      
        <p>   It's gonna be okay       
        <p>   Everyone needs a bad day        
        <p>   Remember you told me       
        <p>   You're not alone, just pick up the phone        
        <p>   And call me whenever you're feeling lonely       
        <p>   Remember you told me       
        <p>   You're not alone, just pick up the phone       
        <p>   You're not alone, you're not alone       
        <p>   Pick up the phone, pick up the phone        
        <p>   You're not alone, you're not alone        
        <p>   Pick up the phone, pick up the phone (pick up the phone)        
        <p>   You're not alone, you're not alone (pick up, pick up the phone)        
        <p>   Pick up the phone, pick up the phone (you're not, you're not alone)        
        <p>   You're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone       
        <p>   It's gonna be okay        
        <p>   Everyone needs a bad day        
        <p>   Remember you told me        
        <p>   You're not alone, just pick up the phone.
