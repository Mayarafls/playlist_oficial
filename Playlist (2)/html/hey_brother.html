        <p>    Hey brother
        <p>    There's an endless road to rediscover
        <p>    Hey sister
        <p>    Know that water's sweet, but blood is thicker
        <p>    Oh, if the sky comes falling down
        <p>    For you
        <p>    There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
        <p>    Hey brother
        <p>    Do you still believe in one another?
        <p>    Hey sister
        <p>    Do you still believe in love? I wonder
        <p>    Oh, if the sky comes falling down
        <p>    For you
        <p>    There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
        <p>    What if I'm far from home?
        <p>    Oh brother, I will hear you call
        <p>    What if I lose it all?
        <p>    Oh sister, I will help you out
        <p>    Oh, if the sky comes falling down
        <p>    For you
        <p>    There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
        <p>    Hey brother
        <p>    There's an endless road to rediscover
        <p>    Hey sister
