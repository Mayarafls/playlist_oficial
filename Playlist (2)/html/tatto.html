    <h2>Loreen</h2>
    <p> I don't wanna go
        <p>    But baby, we both know
        <p>    This is not our time
        <p>    It's time to say goodbye
        <p>    Until we meet again
        <p>    'Cause this is not the end
        <p>    It will come a day
        <p>    When we will find our way
        <p>    Violins playin' and the angels cryin'
        <p>    When the stars align, then I'll be there
        <p>    No, I don't care about them all
        <p>    'Cause all I want is to be loved
        <p>    And all I care about is you
        <p>    You're stuck on me like a tattoo
        <p>    No, I don't care about the pain
        <p>    I'll walk through fire and through rain
        <p>    Just to get closer to you
        <p>    You're stuck on me like a tattoo
        <p>    I'm letting my hair down
        <p>    I'm takin' it cool
        <p>    You got my heart in your hand
        <p>    Don't lose it, my friend
        <p>    It's all that I got
        <p>    Violins playin' and the angels cryin'
        <p>    When the stars align, then I'll be there
        <p>    No, I don't care about them all
        <p>    'Cause all I want is to be loved
        <p>    And all I care about is you
        <p>    You're stuck on me like a tattoo
        <p>    No, I don't care about the pain
        <p>    I'll walk through fire and through rain
        <p>    Just to get closer to you
        <p>    You're stuck on me like a tattoo
        <p>    No, I don't care about them all
        <p>    'Cause all I want is to be loved
        <p>    And all I care about is you
        <p>    You're stuck on me like a tattoo
        <p>    No, I don't care about the pain
        <p>    I'll walk through fire and through rain
        <p>    Just to get closer to you
        <p>    You're stuck on me like a tattoo
        <p>    All I care about is love
        <p>    Oh, oh, oh
        <p>    All I care about is love
        <p>    You're stuck on me like a tattoo. </p>
