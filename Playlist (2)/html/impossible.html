    <h2>James arthur</h2>
        <p>    Mmm-mmm
        <p>    I remember, years ago
        <p>    Someone told me I should take
        <p>    Caution when it comes to love, I did
        <p>    And you were strong and I was not
        <p>    My illusion, my mistake
        <p>    I was careless, I forgot, I did
        <p>    And now
        <p>    When all is done, there is nothing to say
        <p>    You have gone and so effortlessly
        <p>    You have won, you can go ahead, tell them
        <p>    Tell them all I know now
        <p>    Shout it from the rooftops
        <p>    Write it on the skyline
        <p>    All we had is gone now
        <p>    Tell them I was happy
        <p>    And my heart is broken
        <p>     All my scars are open
        <p>    Tell them what I hoped would be impossible
        <p>    Impossible
        <p>    Impossible
        <p>    Impossible
        <p>    Falling out of love is hard
        <p>    Falling for betrayal is worse
        <p>    Broken trust and broken hearts
        <p>    I know, I know
        <p>    And thinking all you need is there
        <p>    Building faith on love and words
        <p>    Empty promises will wear
        <p>    I know
        <p>    I know and now
        <p>    When all is done, there is nothing to say
        <p>    And if you're done with embarrassing me
        <p>    On your own, you can go ahead, tell them
        <p>    Tell them all I know now
        <p>    Shout it from the rooftops
        <p>    Write it on the skyline
        <p>    All we had is gone now
        <p>    Tell them I was happy
        <p>    And my heart is broken
        <p>    All my scars are open
        <p>    Tell them what I hoped would be impossible
        <p>    Impossible
        <p>    Impossible
        <p>    Impossible
        <p>    I remember, years ago
        <p>    Someone told me I should take
        <p>    Caution when it comes to love
        <p>    Tell them all I know now
        <p>    Shout it from the rooftops
        <p>    Write it on the skyline
        <p>    All we had is gone now
        <p>    Tell them I was happy
        <p>    And my heart is broken
        <p>    Oh, hoped would be impossible
        <p>    Impossible (impossible)
        <p>    Impossible (impossible)
        <p>    (Impossible)
        <p>    impossible
        <p>    (Impossible) impossible
        <p>    (Impossible)
        <p>    Impossible
