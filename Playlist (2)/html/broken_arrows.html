    <h2>Avicii</h2>
        <p>    You stripped your love down to the wire
        <p>    Fire shy and cold alone outside
        <p>    You stripped it right down to the wire
        <p>    But I see you behind those tired eyes
        <p>    Now as you wade through shadows that live in your heart
        <p>    You'll find the light that leads home
        <p>    Cause I see you for you and your beautiful scars
        <p>    So take my hand, don't let go
        <p>    Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
        <p>    I, I see the hope in your heart
        <p>    And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting
        <p>    Broken arrows in the dark
        <p>    But I, I see the hope in your heart
        <p>    I've seen the darkness in the light
        <p>    The kind of blue that leaves you lost and blind
        <p>    The only thing that's black and white
        <p>    Is that you don't have to walk alone this time
        <p>    We have to tear down walls that live in your heart
        <p>    To find someone you call home
        <p>    Now you see me for me and my beautiful scars
        <p>    So take my hand, don't let go
        <p>    Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
        <p>    I, I see the hope in your heart
        <p>    And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting
        <p>    Broken arrows in the dark
        <p>    But I, I see the hope in your heart
        <p>    It's not too late, it's not too late
        <p>    I see the hope in your heart
        <p>    Sometimes you're losing, sometimes shooting
        <p>    Broken arrows in the dark
        <p>    Hohoo.
